I am a mathematician working in the area of probability theory and stochastic analysis. Currently I am a PostDoc—2025 Seal of Excellence Laureate (Initiative d’excellence, Université de Lille; SoE-IE)—in the group of Prof. Ciprian Tudor.

Previously, I was a PostDoc in the groups of Prof.  Ivan Nourdin in University of Luxembourg.

My research focuses on developing new tools in Malliavin calculus to investigate densities of non-Gaussian processes (such as Hermite processes and SDEs), Stein method, and local times.
